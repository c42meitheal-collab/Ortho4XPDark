# 🌲 Ortho4XPDark Forest Library - Attribution & Sources

## Library Philosophy

The Ortho4XPDark Forest Library is built with deep respect for the X-Plane community and all forest library creators. This library serves as a curated, integrated collection optimized for Ireland/UK orthoscenery while maintaining global compatibility.

**Core Principle: Every asset is properly attributed to its original creator.**
