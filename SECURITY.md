## Security Best Practices

### **For Users**
- **Download Sources**: Only download from official repositories
- **Verify Integrity**: Check file hashes when available
- **Keep Updated**: Install security updates promptly
- **Backup Data**: Regular backups of X-Plane scenery and configurations
- **Network Security**: Use secure networks for P2P synchronization
- **Permission Review**: Understand what file system access the tool requires

### **For Contributors**
- **Code Review**: All code changes reviewed for security implications
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates to address known vulnerabilities
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all external inputs
- **Error Handling**: Avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages
- **Access Controls**: Implement least-privilege principles
- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines and security best practices

## Known Security Considerations

### **File System Access**
- Ortho4XPDark requires read/write access to X-Plane directories
- Always verify X-Plane installation paths before modification
- Backup important files before running batch operations
- Monitor file operations logs for unexpected behaviour

### **Network Communication**
- P2P synchronization uses standard networking protocols
- All data transmission includes integrity checking
- No personal information transmitted without explicit consent
- Network discovery uses standard broadcast protocols

### **Third-Party Dependencies**
- Regular security audits of Python dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Prompt updates when security issues are discovered
- Documentation of security-relevant dependency choices

### **Intellectual Property Protection**
- Advanced payware detection prevents accidental sharing
- Content filtering respects intellectual property rights
- Legal compliance framework built into sharing protocols
- User education about copyright and distribution rights

## Incident Response

### **Security Incident Classification**
- **Critical**: Remote code execution, data breach, authentication bypass
- **High**: Privilege escalation, information disclosure, service disruption
- **Medium**: Input validation issues, minor information leaks
- **Low**: Configuration issues, documentation problems

### **Response Process**
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
2. **Containment**: Prevent further exploitation
3. **Investigation**: Understand root cause and attack vector
4. **Mitigation**: Deploy fixes and workarounds
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users appropriately
6. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
7. **Lessons Learned**: Improve processes and prevention

### **Communication Strategy**
- **Security Advisories**: Published for confirmed vulnerabilities
- **User Notifications**: Clear guidance on protective actions
- **Community Updates**: Regular security status communications
- **Transparency**: Balanced disclosure that doesn't enable attacks

## Security Architecture

### **Defense in Depth**
- **Input Validation**: Multiple layers of input sanitization
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions and privilege separation
- **Monitoring**: Logging and audit trails for security events
- **Encryption**: Secure communication and data storage where appropriate
- **Backup Systems**: Recovery mechanisms for security incidents

### **Threat Modeling**
Regular assessment of potential attack vectors:
- **Network Attacks**: Man-in-the-middle, packet injection, DDoS
- **File System Attacks**: Path traversal, malicious files, permission escalation
- **Application Attacks**: Code injection, buffer overflows, logic flaws
- **Social Attacks**: Phishing, malicious content distribution
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or development tools

## Compliance and Standards

### **Security Frameworks**
- **OWASP**: Open Web Application Security Project guidelines
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration awareness
- **CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures tracking
- **NIST**: Cybersecurity Framework principles

### **Privacy Considerations**
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **User Consent**: Clear consent for data usage and sharing
- **Data Retention**: Appropriate retention and deletion policies
- **Regional Compliance**: Respect GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws

## Security Tools and Automation

### **Development Security**
